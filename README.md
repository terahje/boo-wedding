## Description
My first passion project, this application came to life using React to build the front end pages.  A wedding website for my forth coming wedding, each page is to share our story with our loved ones.  Utializing the Rumes flip countdown npm package to add a flip style countdown is one of my favorite outcomes of an vision I was unsure how to execute.  The gallery is another page where the idea and execution married wonderfully, using React Bootstrap's carousel component to showcase multiple pictures as a slideshow with clickable buttons.  Last point of mention would be the implentation of flex to control the layout of the pages.
